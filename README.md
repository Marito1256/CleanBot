# CleanBot
refreshing my 2019 discord bot. Updating deprecated api calls and functions 
Add tokens to a .env file for the bot to work.
./registerCommands.js registers the slash commands to discord's catalog of commands
other than moderation also has the following commands so far:
/trash <username> : places that user's pfp on a bag of trash and sends it to chat. uses canvas for image manipulation
/xkcd : retrieves a random xkcd meme and send it to chat.
